# finnkino-film-script

Since [Finnkino](https://www.finnkino.fi) doesn't have any meaningful filters on their website (except genre), I built this script to pull data from [their xml-interface](https://www.finnkino.fi/xml). You can modify this script to get the data that is important to you. I am using it to search for upcoming shows with a specific spoken language.
